## Hyperbolic Representations of Human Action

This code is built on the DPC code in [github.com/TengdaHan/DPC](https://github.com/geoopt/geoopt)
We also used hyperbolic networks from [github.com/geoopt/geoopt](https://github.com/geoopt/geoopt) and hyperbolic
operations from the
[geoopt](https://github.com/geoopt/geoopt) library.

Under `script` there are example bash files to run the self-supervised training and finetuning, and the 
supervised training and testing of our model.
